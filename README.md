Majordodo is a platform to build complex multi-tenant distributed computing grids. You can think about it as a distributed threadpool, to which tasks are submitted by users and a network of brokers schedules execcution on a large set of machines, caring about failures, recovery and priority-based resources assignment. Tasks are implemented (in version 1.0) in Java and can be submitted and monitored using a simple HTTP REST JSON API.
